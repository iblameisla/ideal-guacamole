      <h1>what are they?</h1>
      <p>Symbols are a big part of culture,</p>
      <p>and have been used throughout history.</p>
      <p>Over the years of everyday practice,</p>
      <p>these symbols have been nurtured into having a meaning for specific cultures/people,</p>
      <p>but I think that they are not needed.</p>
      
      <p> These symbols in their culture, have no need to be included. This takes away a sense of self as it makes you part of a bigger group of people, stripping away your individual identity just for the choice that some other people have made. The symbols that these people are represented by become part of their being, part of their life. This is usually not a choice. <p>

        <p> These usually represent a person who lives in a country, or someone part of a tribe,<p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-big"> <p> 
       These can also be represented in the form of a National flag, with you having no choice whatsoever of choosing if you are represented by what sort of flag, other than moving to a different country. <p>

      <p> These connections that they have to people are usually forced, and not the wish of the person this is applied to. Newborn kids are instantly classified as part of a symbol without even getting the chance to grow up before choosing this. <p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-big">
        <p> In the case of these symbols, it's not fair to people who do not wish to be part of a flag or symbol, and these should be abolished

     <p> I have expressed my dislike for these symbols in the text, and in conclusion, I believe that we should get rid of these as a whole, and those who wish to be part of some sort of culture express it in a different way than what has happened in the past.
